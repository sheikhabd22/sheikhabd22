Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! If you’re here to judge my code, please do it kindly... or at least with snacks. 🍕

  Always learning, mostly by Googling my own errors.

🛠 Tech Stack
  Languages: Python, JavaScript, Java (and fluent in Stack Overflow)
  Frameworks: React, Flask, FastAPI (and the occasional magic incantation to make things work)
